\section{Improvements: 2 to 2.1}
\subsection{Ignoring prepositions}
The earlier version ignores extractions if the path has any modifier like increase, decrease, rose.
The idea was to ignore sentences that only communicate change in quantities. For example, 
\emph{The internet user percent has increased by 3.4 over the last year due to telecom reforms.}

However, vanilla implementation of this idea leads to false negatives. Consider:
\emph{The population of India \textbf{increased to} 1.3 billion.}
