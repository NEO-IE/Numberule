\section{Improvements: 2 to 2.1}
\subsection{Ignoring modifiers preceded by \emph{to}}
The earlier version ignores extractions if the path has any modifier like increase, decrease, rose.
The idea was to ignore sentences that only communicate change in quantities. For example, 
\emph{The internet user percent has increased by 3.4 over the last year due to telecom reforms.}

However, vanilla implementation of this idea leads to false negatives. Consider:
\emph{The population of India \textbf{increased to} 1.3 billion.}

\subsection{Handling Redundant Extractions and Spurious pairs}

For a given augmented entity phrase E\footnote{the augmented phrases are as defined in the earlier writeup}, and a given augmented relation phrase R, Let
\begin{itemize}


\item $N_1$, $N_2$, ..., $N_i$ be the numbers such that modified shortest path hypothesis leads to extractions 
$R_C(E, R, N_1)$, $R_C(E, R, N_2)$, ... , $R_C(E, R, N_n)$ where $R_C$ is the relation code.
\item Let $|E, N_i|$ be the shortest distance from the central entity of the entity phrase to the $ith$ number. 

\item Let $|E, N_k| \leq |E, N_i| \  \forall i \in [1, n]$. 

\end{itemize}

Then, we ignore all the extractions except $R_C(E, R, N_k)$.
